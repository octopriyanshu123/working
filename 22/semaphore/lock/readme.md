In C++, when using `std::lock_guard`, you **do not manually release** the lock. The `std::lock_guard` is designed to automatically release the lock when it goes out of scope. This behavior is part of its **RAII** (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) design. The lock is acquired when the `std::lock_guard` object is created and released when the object is destroyed, typically when it goes out of scope (i.e., when the function or block of code that contains the `std::lock_guard` ends).

### Example of `std::lock_guard` Usage

Here’s a simple example to demonstrate the automatic release of the lock:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>

std::mutex data_mutex;
int my_data = 0;

void increment_data(int id) {
    // Lock the mutex using std::lock_guard
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(data_mutex);  // Lock acquired here

    // Critical section: modify the shared data
    my_data++;
    std::cout << "Thread " << id << " incremented my_data to " << my_data << std::endl;

    // No need to manually unlock the mutex. It will be unlocked automatically
    // when lock goes out of scope (end of function or block).
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(increment_data, 1);
    std::thread t2(increment_data, 2);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    std::cout << "Final value of my_data: " << my_data << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points:
- The mutex is locked when `std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(data_mutex)` is created.
- The lock is automatically released when the `std::lock_guard` object goes out of scope, which happens when the function or the block of code ends.
- **No manual unlocking is needed**. This is the main benefit of using `std::lock_guard` as it ensures that the lock will be released even if an exception occurs, preventing potential deadlocks.

### Example Output:
```
Thread 1 incremented my_data to 1
Thread 2 incremented my_data to 2
Final value of my_data: 2
```

### Why You Don’t Need to Manually Release the Lock:
The `std::lock_guard` is designed for simplicity and safety. When you exit the scope where `std::lock_guard` is declared, the object is destroyed, and its destructor automatically releases the lock. This avoids mistakes such as forgetting to unlock the mutex or accidentally leaving a mutex locked.

If you need to have more control over when to release the lock, you can use `std::unique_lock`, which allows you to unlock the mutex manually if needed.
