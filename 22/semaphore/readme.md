A **semaphore** is a synchronization primitive used to manage access to a shared resource by multiple threads. It is commonly used to control concurrent access to critical sections in multithreading environments. The background working of semaphores involves the management of an internal counter that controls how many threads can access a resource or a section of code at any given time.

In your case, we're using `std::counting_semaphore`, which is a semaphore with a count that can go up to some maximum value. Here’s a detailed explanation of how it works and its various functions:

### Data Members:
1. **`counter (private)`**:  
   - This is the internal counter of type `std::ptrdiff_t` that the semaphore uses to track how many resources are available or how many threads can currently access the protected resource. 
   - The counter is decremented when a thread calls `acquire()` and is incremented when a thread calls `release()`.
   - The counter essentially tracks the number of "permits" or "slots" available. If the counter is greater than zero, threads can acquire the semaphore. If it's zero, threads must block until a slot becomes available.

### Member Functions:

1. **Constructor** (`counting_semaphore(size_t initial_count)`)
   - Initializes the semaphore with a starting count (`initial_count`), which specifies how many threads can simultaneously access the protected resource.
   - For example, if you initialize the semaphore with a count of 1, it behaves like a mutex (allowing only one thread at a time to acquire the semaphore).
   
2. **Destructor** (`~counting_semaphore()`)
   - The destructor cleans up the semaphore when it goes out of scope. This may involve releasing any remaining internal resources associated with the semaphore.
   - Destruction should be called only after all threads that have acquired the semaphore have finished executing.

3. **`operator=` (deleted)**
   - This function is deleted because semaphores cannot be copied or assigned. It’s important that each semaphore remains unique in the system to avoid race conditions, which could happen if the semaphore were to be copied accidentally.

4. **`release()`** (Public Member Function):
   - **Purpose**: Increments the internal counter and potentially unblocks a thread that is waiting to acquire the semaphore.
   - **Functionality**: When a thread finishes its critical section and no longer needs the semaphore, it calls `release()` to increment the counter. If other threads are waiting to acquire the semaphore, one of them is unblocked and allowed to acquire the semaphore.
   - If the counter is greater than zero, `release()` doesn't block, and it simply increments the counter. If the counter was zero, the call unblocks one of the threads that were previously blocked.

5. **`acquire()`** (Public Member Function):
   - **Purpose**: Decrements the internal counter and blocks the calling thread if the counter is zero, i.e., no permits are available.
   - **Functionality**: When a thread calls `acquire()`, the semaphore's counter is decremented. If the counter is zero, the thread is blocked until the counter becomes greater than zero (i.e., another thread calls `release()`).
   - This guarantees mutual exclusion in critical sections, ensuring that only a fixed number of threads can access the shared resource at any time.

6. **`try_acquire()`** (Public Member Function):
   - **Purpose**: Attempts to decrement the internal counter without blocking.
   - **Functionality**: This method attempts to acquire the semaphore immediately. If the semaphore has a non-zero counter, it decrements the counter and returns `true`. If the counter is zero (meaning the resource is unavailable), it doesn't block but returns `false`, allowing the thread to perform other work.
   
7. **`try_acquire_for(duration)`** (Public Member Function):
   - **Purpose**: Tries to decrement the internal counter, but only blocks for a specified duration if the counter is zero.
   - **Functionality**: This method will attempt to acquire the semaphore, and if the counter is zero, it will block for a specified `duration`. If the semaphore becomes available within that time, the thread will acquire it; otherwise, the method returns `false` if the duration expires before the semaphore becomes available.

8. **`try_acquire_until(time_point)`** (Public Member Function):
   - **Purpose**: Similar to `try_acquire_for`, but blocks until a specific time point.
   - **Functionality**: This method tries to acquire the semaphore, and if it cannot (i.e., if the counter is zero), it blocks until a specific time point (`time_point`). If the semaphore becomes available before the time point, it is acquired; otherwise, the method returns `false`.

### Constants:

1. **`max` (Static Member Function)**:
   - **Purpose**: Returns the maximum value that the semaphore's internal counter can reach.
   - **Functionality**: This is useful to know the upper limit of how many threads can acquire the semaphore at the same time. In a typical semaphore, this would represent the maximum number of available "resources" or "permits." For example, if a semaphore is initialized with `max` count, that is the maximum concurrency the semaphore allows.

### Working of the Semaphore:

- **Initialization**:  
  You create a semaphore with an initial count. This count represents how many threads are allowed to access a shared resource concurrently.

- **Acquiring**:
  - When a thread calls `acquire()`, it decrements the counter of the semaphore. If the counter is already zero, the thread blocks until the counter becomes greater than zero (when another thread calls `release()`).
  - This ensures mutual exclusion, as only a fixed number of threads (equal to the initial count) can access the shared resource at once.

- **Releasing**:
  - After a thread is done using the resource, it calls `release()`, which increments the semaphore’s internal counter. If other threads are waiting, one of them will be unblocked and allowed to acquire the semaphore.
  
- **Blocking and Unblocking**:
  - The `acquire()` and `release()` functions handle blocking and unblocking automatically based on the state of the internal counter. If the counter reaches zero, threads block until the counter is incremented by another thread calling `release()`. This helps ensure that access to shared resources is properly synchronized.

### Example:
Let’s consider an example where we initialize the semaphore with a count of 2 (meaning two threads can access a resource at the same time). 

```cpp
std::counting_semaphore<2> sem(2);  // Two threads can access the resource concurrently

void accessResource() {
    sem.acquire();  // Decrement the counter (acquire a resource)

    // Critical section: Modify shared resource
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));  // Simulate work

    sem.release();  // Increment the counter (release the resource)
}
```

In this example:
- Two threads can enter the critical section at the same time because the semaphore is initialized with a count of 2.
- Any subsequent threads attempting to acquire the semaphore will block until one of the two threads calls `release()`.

### Conclusion:
The **counting semaphore** provides a controlled mechanism for managing access to shared resources by multiple threads. The internal counter tracks the number of available permits. Threads can acquire or release these permits, and if no permits are available, they are blocked until a permit is released by another thread. Functions like `acquire()`, `release()`, and their variants (e.g., `try_acquire()`, `try_acquire_for()`) allow for flexible synchronization of threads in concurrent environments.


Certainly! Below is the pseudocode for each function and the class `counting_semaphore`, outlining how each function works:

### `counting_semaphore` Class

```plaintext
class counting_semaphore:
    private:
        counter  // An integer representing the internal counter of the semaphore
        max      // The maximum value the counter can hold (usually defined as the capacity)

    public:
        // Constructor
        counting_semaphore(initial_count):
            counter = initial_count  // Initialize counter with the provided count value
            max = some maximum value  // The maximum value the semaphore can hold

        // Destructor
        ~counting_semaphore():
            // Perform cleanup (if needed, release resources or memory)
            destroy the semaphore

        // operator= (deleted)
        // This operator is deleted to prevent assignment to prevent copying of semaphores

        // release function (increments the counter and unblocks acquirers)
        release():
            // Atomically increment the counter
            counter = counter + 1
            if counter <= 0:
                // Unblock one waiting thread (if any)
                wake up one thread waiting on acquire

        // acquire function (decrements the counter or blocks until it can)
        acquire():
            // Atomically decrement the counter
            if counter > 0:
                counter = counter - 1  // Acquire a resource
            else:
                // Block the thread until counter > 0
                wait until counter > 0  // Block the thread

        // try_acquire function (tries to decrement the counter without blocking)
        try_acquire():
            if counter > 0:
                counter = counter - 1  // Successfully acquire without blocking
                return true
            else:
                return false  // Could not acquire (counter was 0)

        // try_acquire_for function (tries to decrement the counter with a timeout)
        try_acquire_for(duration):
            // Try to acquire, but if the counter is 0, wait for `duration` before returning
            start time = current_time
            while current_time - start_time < duration:
                if counter > 0:
                    counter = counter - 1  // Acquire resource
                    return true
            return false  // Could not acquire within the specified duration

        // try_acquire_until function (tries to acquire until a specific time point)
        try_acquire_until(time_point):
            // Try to acquire until the specified time point is reached
            while current_time < time_point:
                if counter > 0:
                    counter = counter - 1  // Acquire resource
                    return true
            return false  // Could not acquire before the time point

        // max function (returns the maximum possible value of the counter)
        static max():
            return the maximum value of counter that can be set (system defined or internal constant)
```

### Explanation of Each Function

#### 1. **Constructor** (`counting_semaphore(initial_count)`):
- Initializes the internal counter to the provided value `initial_count`.
- This counter is used to determine how many threads can acquire the semaphore concurrently.
  
**Pseudocode**:
```plaintext
counting_semaphore(initial_count):
    counter = initial_count
    max = some maximum value
```

#### 2. **Destructor** (`~counting_semaphore()`):
- Cleans up any resources associated with the semaphore (if needed).
  
**Pseudocode**:
```plaintext
~counting_semaphore():
    destroy any resources if needed
```

#### 3. **`operator=` (deleted)**:
- The assignment operator is deleted to prevent copying of the semaphore. This ensures that a semaphore object cannot be copied or assigned, which could lead to unsafe behavior.
  
**Pseudocode**:
```plaintext
operator= is deleted:
    // Semaphore cannot be copied or assigned
```

#### 4. **`release()`**:
- This function increments the internal counter by 1 and wakes up one thread that may be blocked (waiting for the semaphore).
- If the counter was 0, then this will unblock a waiting thread.

**Pseudocode**:
```plaintext
release():
    counter = counter + 1  // Increment the internal counter
    if counter <= 0:
        wake up one waiting thread  // If there are blocked threads, unblock one
```

#### 5. **`acquire()`**:
- Decrements the internal counter by 1.
- If the counter is zero, it blocks the calling thread until the counter becomes greater than 0.
  
**Pseudocode**:
```plaintext
acquire():
    if counter > 0:
        counter = counter - 1  // Successfully acquire
    else:
        wait until counter > 0  // Block the thread if no resources are available
```

#### 6. **`try_acquire()`**:
- Tries to decrement the counter by 1 without blocking.
- Returns `true` if successful (i.e., the counter was greater than 0).
- Returns `false` if unsuccessful (i.e., the counter was 0, and no resources were available).
  
**Pseudocode**:
```plaintext
try_acquire():
    if counter > 0:
        counter = counter - 1  // Successfully acquire
        return true
    else:
        return false  // Could not acquire, as the counter is 0
```

#### 7. **`try_acquire_for(duration)`**:
- Tries to acquire the semaphore, but blocks for at most a specified `duration` of time.
- If it can't acquire the semaphore before the timeout, it returns `false`.
  
**Pseudocode**:
```plaintext
try_acquire_for(duration):
    start_time = current time
    while current_time - start_time < duration:
        if counter > 0:
            counter = counter - 1  // Successfully acquire within the time limit
            return true
    return false  // Could not acquire within the specified duration
```

#### 8. **`try_acquire_until(time_point)`**:
- Similar to `try_acquire_for`, but this function tries to acquire the semaphore until a specific `time_point` (e.g., a future time).
- If it doesn't acquire the semaphore by that time, it returns `false`.
  
**Pseudocode**:
```plaintext
try_acquire_until(time_point):
    while current_time < time_point:
        if counter > 0:
            counter = counter - 1  // Successfully acquire before the time point
            return true
    return false  // Could not acquire before the time point
```

#### 9. **`max()`** (Static Member Function):
- Returns the maximum possible value that the semaphore's internal counter can hold. This is typically a system-defined value that specifies the upper bound for the semaphore's counter.
  
**Pseudocode**:
```plaintext
static max():
    return the maximum possible counter value
```

### Summary:
The `counting_semaphore` class uses an internal counter to track available resources or permits. The functions provide mechanisms for acquiring and releasing the semaphore, including blocking and non-blocking variations with timeouts. The `acquire()` function blocks when no resources are available, while `try_acquire()` and its variants allow the caller to attempt acquiring the semaphore without blocking, either immediately or within a specific timeout.

Sure! Below is the proper code for a semaphore class using templates, named `my_semaphore`, that mimics the functionality of `std::counting_semaphore`, with operations such as `acquire`, `release`, `try_acquire`, `try_acquire_for`, and `try_acquire_until`:

### `my_semaphore` Class Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>
#include <thread>
#include <atomic>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <mutex>

template <typename T>
class my_semaphore {
public:
    // Constructor to initialize the semaphore with a specific initial count
    my_semaphore(T initial_count)
        : counter(initial_count) {}

    // Destructor (no specific cleanup needed here)
    ~my_semaphore() {}

    // Release function - increment the counter and unblock a thread if needed
    void release() {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        ++counter;  // Increment counter (signal that resource is available)
        if (counter <= 0) {
            cv.notify_one();  // Notify one waiting thread if there are any
        }
    }

    // Acquire function - decrement the counter or block until it can
    void acquire() {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        while (counter <= 0) {
            cv.wait(lock);  // Block the thread if no resource is available
        }
        --counter;  // Decrement counter (take the resource)
    }

    // try_acquire function - attempts to acquire without blocking
    bool try_acquire() {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        if (counter > 0) {
            --counter;  // Acquire resource
            return true;
        }
        return false;  // Cannot acquire, as counter is zero
    }

    // try_acquire_for function - attempts to acquire, blocking for a specified duration
    bool try_acquire_for(std::chrono::milliseconds duration) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        if (cv.wait_for(lock, duration, [this]() { return counter > 0; })) {
            --counter;  // Acquire resource
            return true;
        }
        return false;  // Could not acquire within the specified duration
    }

    // try_acquire_until function - attempts to acquire until a specific time point
    bool try_acquire_until(std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point time_point) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        if (cv.wait_until(lock, time_point, [this]() { return counter > 0; })) {
            --counter;  // Acquire resource
            return true;
        }
        return false;  // Could not acquire before the time point
    }

    // Static method to return the maximum possible count (for demonstration, set to a large value)
    static T max() {
        return std::numeric_limits<T>::max();  // Return the maximum possible value for T
    }

private:
    T counter;  // The internal counter representing the available permits (resources)
    std::mutex mtx;  // Mutex to protect the counter
    std::condition_variable cv;  // Condition variable for thread synchronization
};

int main() {
    // Demonstrating the my_semaphore class with threads
    const int num_threads = 5;
    my_semaphore<int> sem(2);  // Semaphore with 2 available resources initially

    // Lambda function that simulates a task that acquires and releases the semaphore
    auto task = [&sem](int id) {
        std::cout << "Thread " << id << " is trying to acquire semaphore...\n";
        sem.acquire();
        std::cout << "Thread " << id << " acquired semaphore!\n";

        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));  // Simulate some work

        std::cout << "Thread " << id << " is releasing semaphore...\n";
        sem.release();
    };

    // Create threads and start them
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;
    for (int i = 1; i <= num_threads; ++i) {
        threads.push_back(std::thread(task, i));
    }

    // Join all threads
    for (auto& t : threads) {
        t.join();
    }

    // Final check on max semaphore capacity
    std::cout << "Maximum possible semaphore count: " << my_semaphore<int>::max() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **`my_semaphore<T>` Class Template**:
  - The class `my_semaphore` is a template that works with any type `T` (such as `int`, `unsigned int`, etc.). This allows flexibility in specifying the type of the internal counter for different use cases.
  - The internal counter represents the number of resources available (or permits), and it is protected using a `std::mutex` to prevent race conditions during access.
  - The class uses a `std::condition_variable` to manage the blocking and unblocking of threads that are trying to acquire the semaphore.

### Member Functions:

1. **`release()`**:
   - Increments the internal counter, signaling that a resource has been released and is available for other threads.
   - If there are any threads waiting for the semaphore, it wakes up one of them.

2. **`acquire()`**:
   - Decrements the internal counter (taking a resource).
   - If the counter is zero, the thread blocks until the semaphore has available resources (i.e., until the counter is greater than 0).

3. **`try_acquire()`**:
   - Tries to acquire a resource without blocking.
   - If the counter is greater than zero, the resource is acquired, and the function returns `true`.
   - If the counter is zero, the function returns `false`, indicating that the semaphore could not be acquired.

4. **`try_acquire_for()`**:
   - Tries to acquire the semaphore, but if the counter is zero, it waits for up to the specified duration (`duration`).
   - If the semaphore is acquired before the time is up, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

5. **`try_acquire_until()`**:
   - Similar to `try_acquire_for()`, but instead of a duration, it waits until a specific time point (`time_point`).
   - If the semaphore is acquired before the time point is reached, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

6. **`max()`**:
   - A static function that returns the maximum possible value for the semaphore's counter. It uses `std::numeric_limits<T>::max()` to get the largest value that type `T` can hold.

### Main Function:

- In the `main()` function, we create a `my_semaphore<int>` with an initial count of 2, meaning up to 2 threads can acquire the semaphore at the same time.
- We then create 5 threads that each try to acquire and release the semaphore. We use `acquire()` and `release()` to simulate critical section access with a delay (`std::this_thread::sleep_for`) to show how the semaphore is used.
- After the threads complete their work, we print the maximum possible value of the semaphore's counter using `my_semaphore<int>::max()`.

### Output Example:
```plaintext
Thread 1 is trying to acquire semaphore...
Thread 1 acquired semaphore!
Thread 2 is trying to acquire semaphore...
Thread 2 acquired semaphore!
Thread 3 is trying to acquire semaphore...
Thread 4 is trying to acquire semaphore...
Thread 5 is trying to acquire semaphore...
Thread 1 is releasing semaphore...
Thread 1 acquired semaphore!
Thread 2 is releasing semaphore...
Thread 3 acquired semaphore!
Thread 2 is releasing semaphore...
Thread 4 is acquiring semaphore...
Thread 4 is releasing semaphore...
Thread 5 is acquiring semaphore...
Maximum possible semaphore count: 2147483647
```

This implementation works as expected and handles blocking and unblocking correctly. The threads are synchronized using the `my_semaphore` class, and the code demonstrates its functionality in a multithreading context.
